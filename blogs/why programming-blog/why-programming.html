            The technological developments characterize the 21st century. Wherever we look at, whatever we
            use has something to do with technology. From the alarm clock on our phones that wake us up in the morning,
            the coffee machine that makes us coffee at the push of a button, to the smartphones and internet that make
            our life easier, all those are using some technology.
            <br>
            Behind most everything we see on the internet‚Äîevery word, picture, chart, layout, etc.‚Äîthere is someone who
            programmed it to look as such to us. So why should you learn to program? Here are some of the
            reasons.

            <h2>You Can Create Anything You Want</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            At its core, computer programming gives you the ability to digitize your ideas. Imagine being able to
            actually implement any idea that you could think about! You know that idea you have for an awesome app that
            would go viral once it was released out into the wild. Yeah that one ‚Äì you could actually create that
            yourself. Let‚Äôs face it, if you are like most people, you might not have a giant pile of cash stashed away
            to hire somebody to make that app for you because it can get very expensive, very quickly. Even if you had
            the cash, do you think if Jack Dorsey, who came up with the idea of creating Twitter, if he did not have the
            ability to code, would
            Twitter still exist? The answer is probably a resounding ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù. This is one good reason
            why you should learn how to program.

            <h2>No Need for a Four-Year Degree</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            While one of the paths to becoming a programmer is to earn a computer science degree, you can still become
            one without a degree. Many programming jobs don‚Äôt require a computer science or an IT degree instead,
            they‚Äôre interested in your coding abilities. This means that even though a degree would be useful and open
            several doors for you, it isn‚Äôt a must.
            <br>
            However, there are other options better than a degree, that could potentially help you land a job. For
            instance, if you were to graduate from NeoG Camp, it would certainly change your life.

            <h2>It Teaches You Persistence</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            Learning computer programming teaches you to see the problems in the light of solutions. For every problem
            you may face, you start to brainstorm ideas on how to solve it. Fruitful results that come out of
            brainstorming and fixing problems will give you a positive outlook, and toughen you up to act on the problem
            however hard it may be. You become determined to find a way to work out a solution, becoming this way a
            solution-driven person.
        </p>

        <center>
            <h2>You Develop Problem Solving Skills</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            In the world of programming, it is often said that coding is all about solving problems, and computer
            programs should solve problems for us. Learning programming is more or less coding and determining how to
            tackle the issues that arise during coding and finding solutions for them. The more you get to solve these
            problems, the more practical it becomes. You might even start applying this problem-solving mindset in
            different aspects of your professional life and not only while coding.

            <h2>Money</h2>
        </center>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            ‚ÄúYou can have everything in life that you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they
            want‚Äù. ‚Äì Zig Ziglar
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You will only make money when you can solve other people‚Äôs problems and help them achieve their dreams. That
            is effectively what a job actually is by definition. An entrepreneur who starts his own business is also
            simply trying to help others reach their goals and in turn those others help the entrepreneur reach his or
            her goal of financial freedom. Since computer programming has problem solving as one of its main reasons for
            existing, you can imagine that you will be extremely valuable to many people. You will be an asset that they
            could bring on board in order to help them digitize their million dollar idea. They will be more than happy
            to pay you a healthy chunk of money when you help them implement their ideas and turn them into a reality.
